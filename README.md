ðŸ˜Ž My name is MiZZeR, my favourite buisness are playing video games and also create them! Uhh... I lied a little and I don't make games, but that's it for now!  
âœ… In current time I learn web-programming stubbornly and most like front-end developing and also create UI/UX for applications.  

## ðŸ›¡ Front-End
> SASS (SCSS)  
> React (MobX, Redux)
> TypeScript
> Vue (not to say, that I know it well, but I have basic understanding how it works)
  
Of course, I know HTML, CSS (flexbox, grid), Bootstrap, BEM methodology etc, but I think, that it is base of web and every web-developer must understand they are.   
What about design? I working in common applications like Photoshop and Figma and have a small portfolio which I share with you after some time. This portfolio contains UX/UI desings of kind applications and more.

## ðŸ”§ Back-End
